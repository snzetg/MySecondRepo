TODO: 

 - install git 
 - create an account on github.com
 
 
 - open gitbash/terminal and practice navigation
		- cd .. --> go back
		- cd folderLocation --> go to that folder
		- ls 	--> show all the files and folders in the current directory
		- pwd   --> print working directory (show me the current folder I am at)
		

Working with git: 
	- git --version --> it should print the git version 
	
	
	Stuff that you could see only at the beginning: 
		- set username: git config --global user.name "yourUserName"
		- set email:	git config --global user.email "yourEmail@abc.com"
		in case you want to find out if you already have an email or username set, just type the same command
		without giving the last part (values)
	
	- create a folder somewhere on your user (or you can use a current project that you practice codes on)
	
	- when you are sure you are there, type: 
		- git init  --> this will initialize a new empty repository
				-- then create files, make any changes etc. 
			- use git status to see the current status of all files there
		
		- git add . --> this will move all changes (modification and new created files) to the staging area
			- use git status .....
		
		- git commit -m "My first commit"   --> this will commit changes to the local repository
	
	
	
	Pushing everything to the REMOTE REPOSITORY: 
	
		Things you will see only once: 
		*********when you try to push something to the remote repository for the first time, you will have 
				 to be authenticated. (Token authentication!!!)
			for this, watch the First Time Authentication video
		
	- On your github account, go to my repositories, new repository	
		- add a name for this repository: MyFirstRepo
		
	- when you create a new repository
		- check out the commands under: â€¦or push an existing repository from the command line
			-	git remote add origin https://github.com/sbushaj93/TestRepo.git
					- creates a link between your local repository and this new created online repository
			- 	git branch -M main
					- renames your branch from master to main
			- 	git push -u origin main *********
					- sends your changes to the online repository and creates a tracker for this online repo
					- it means next time you want to send something you will only have to write: git push
